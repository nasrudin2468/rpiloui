[MAIN]
# Basic program configuration

# debug flag: activate detailed debug msg output on main thread
# type: boolean
# factory setting: false
debug = true


[GAMESETTINGS]
# enable and disable specific features, alter overall game behavior


[CALIBRATION]

# maxduty: 	limits maximum pwm voltage by limiting maximum dutycycle to prevent 
# 			motor damage
# type: integer
# range: 1-100 [%]
# factory setting: 100

# pwmfreq:	frequency used for pwm cycle (motor)
# type: integer
# range: unkown
# factory setting: 100

# dirdeathtime: motor stop time to wait before activation into opposite 
# 				direction to prevent motor damage. time is calculated for maximum
# 				speed. the raw parameter is defined for maximum motor speed and 
#				scales with duty cycle.
